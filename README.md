This repository is maintained by [UI Core](mailto:team-ui-core@knime.com).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need to have [Proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) installed, which acts as a version manager for Node.js and pnpm.
Once installed you need to run

```

```
pnpm install
```

The monorepo comprises the following packages:

- **@knime/kds-styles**: Contains the design tokens and icons used across the KNIME Design System.
- **@knime/kds-components**: Contains Vue components derived from the design tokens.
- **@knime/kds-documentation**: Contains a Storybook instance that functions as the documentation for the design system and the components.
